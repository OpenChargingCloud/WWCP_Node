/**
 * What a time server or a name server is held to, as the pages edit it and

 *
 * Run with `npm test`. What is pinned is that a pin goes to the
 * node in the keys its file says it with and nowhere else - a pin that
 * also stays behind under a key it was written with before is two pins, and a
 * pin under a key the node does not read is none - and that what
 * somebody pastes is read as the fingerprint they meant or refused, never
 * shortened into another one. The same as the vehicle's, from the same rules.

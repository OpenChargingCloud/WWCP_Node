/**
 * Which entry a drawn line shows.

 * The log page draws newest first while the store keeps its entries oldest
 * first, and it pairs the two by position: a line is built once and then only
 * told whether a filter still wants it, rather than every line being built
 * again for every keystroke in the search box. That pairing is the one thing
 * holding the arrangement together, and it is invisible - get it wrong by one
 * and every line shows one entry while being filtered by another, with
 * nothing on screen to say so.
 *
 * So it lives here, as two functions that must agree, rather than as an index
 * expression written out at each of the three places that needs it.

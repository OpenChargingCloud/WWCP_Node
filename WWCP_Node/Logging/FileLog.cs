    /// The console shows what is happening to whoever is watching, and the web
    /// interface keeps the last two thousand entries for whoever asks. Both are
    /// gone when the process is: a console that was not being read kept
    /// nothing, and the ring buffer empties with the node. Everything that
    /// wants answering afterwards - what a station replied at four in the
    /// morning, what the clock did last week, which discovery preceded the
    /// session that failed - needs a third place, and this is it.
    ///
    /// One file per day, named for the date, appended to and flushed after
    /// every entry. Flushing every time costs a system call per entry and buys
    /// the property that matters here: a node that is killed, or that
    /// crashes, has its last lines on disk rather than in a buffer. The volume
    /// this writes - a busy charging session is a few thousand lines - makes
    /// that trade an easy one.
    ///
    /// Nothing is ever deleted. A simulator that quietly threw away the
    /// evidence of the run somebody is asking about would be worse than one
    /// that needs a directory emptied now and then.
    ///
    /// A file that cannot be written does not take the node down, and does
    /// not bury the console under one complaint per entry either. It is said
    /// once on stderr, every following entry is tried again, and the first one
    /// that makes it is preceded in the file by a line saying how many are
    /// missing and since when. A disk that was full for an hour must not cost
    /// the rest of the run - and a gap the file admits to is one somebody can
    /// reason about, where a silent one is only found by the person who needed
    /// what was in it.
